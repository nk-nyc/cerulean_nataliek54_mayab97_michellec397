01-12-2026 Natalie K. -- Updated README.md to match requirements and fixed page setup. Also put navbar into home.html

INITIAL DD REVIEW
- clarified on category, visibility, join_perms and invite_perms in devlog
- added missing fields to tables
- added labeling to front end diagram for logging out

- Have copied over a lot of code into data.py from previous projects
- Added as many accessors and mutators as I could think of
- Got login and register to work
- No compile errors from data yet but not merging current state with main bc ik some functions don't work as intended yet

- added working calendar (omg that took so long)
- still need to do create tasks! yay! waiting on task functions

- finished middleware, probably (works with what I currently tested, can't think of anything I'm missing)
- finished profile: change pfp, change passwd, change who can invite you to tasks, see list of friends, send/accept/decline friend requests. But it's unstyled.
- minor updates on design doc to reflect changes in storing things that I found along the way (adding NOT NULL to some stuff, making deadline a date)
